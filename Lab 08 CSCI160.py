Assignment

Write each of the following functions. The function header must be implemented exactly as
specified. Write a main function that tests each of your functions.

Specifics

In the main function ask for a filename from the user and call fillListFromFile . This will
return a list with the values from the file. Each file should have one numeric value per line.
Reading numbers from a file has been done numerous times in class. You can create the data
file using a text editor or the example given in class â€“ do not create this file in this program.
Then call each of the required functions and then display the results returned from the functions.
Remember that the functions themselves will not display any output, they will return values that
can then be written to the screen.

If there are built in functions in Python that will accomplish the tasks lists below YOU CANNOT
USE THEM. The purpose of this lab is to get practice working with lists, not to get practice
searching for methods. DO NOT sort the list, that changes the order of the items. The order of
the values in the list should be the same as the order of the values in the file.

For each function that returns a numeric value determined from the list, unless otherwise stated
in the function , if you are unable to determine a value return None .
